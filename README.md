# Random arduino sketches to share. 

## Scarecrow_RGBLed 
<p>Sketch will run a small barbie size scarecrow with an RGB led in a ping pong ball. See image in the repro It simulated a flickering orange color like a candle in a pumpkin.</p>

## pez 
<p>Sketch runs my automated PEZ machine on a 3D printed base. A 4 wire ping sensor (HC-SR04) detects a hand moving in front and a servo opens the head. Just a fun little project.</p>
